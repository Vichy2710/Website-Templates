                            I hired Kocha to lead the design of Finder’s mobile app. Kocha’s contributions have been instrumental. He intuitively mixes user research insights with product ideas, then shapes it into an elegant user experience. Most importantly, Kocha is so much fun to work with. An inclusive team player at heart, he brings such humility and openness to his way of working that everyone can’t wait to work with him. I’ve loved every minute working with Kocha.

He hit the ground running and delivered designs which were thoroughly thought out and ironed out complex user journeys.

This allowed us to complete the project on a tight deadline, without compromising on aesthetics.

                            Kocha is one of those rare breed of designer. Some designers get very wrapped up in what others are doing or what they are comfortable with but he approaches every feature with a fresh UX perspective and an unbiased lens. Kocha's visual skills are very refined and everything he designs has time and maximum effort put in which our developers loved!

                            Kocha’s designs are purposeful, practical and very user friendly. It is user friendly not only to the end users, but also the developer building it out. I had a lot of fun building out Kocha’s design because he resolved every decision that needs design thinking, eliminating the need of me going back and forth during design handovers. I find it a joy to be working with Kocha’s designs.

                            Outside work, Kocha is super chill, easy to get along. We had good time chatting about philosophy, approach to design, and craftsmanship. Chemistry in a relationship is hard to describe using words, but you get a taste of it when you work with Kocha.

                            Kocha is the rare breed of designer who combines (in no particular order) a deep empathy for the end user, an intimate understanding of design principles, especially around UI & mobile, a meticulous and solid work ethic and an all round friendly demeanour.

                            We (at uno) have engaged him on two projects and found his work to be of high quality and his communication excellent throughout. Like all great creative people he thrives when given plenty of context, latitude and creative space. Thanks for everything Kocha

                            I was lucky enough to work with Kocha on a recent project with Uno Home Loans. We had tight deadlines and a rather ambitious end-to-end design review of an existing mobile app.                        
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And yet, Kocha was able to over deliver and delight us with his final solution.Along with his insightful design thinking and beautifully crafted designs, Kocha also brought an incredible passion and energy to the project. He kept us well informed on progress and shared his ideas early so we could iterate together and ultimately arrive at the best solution.It’s hard to articulate exactly… but there’s an attention to detail in every question Kocha asked and every interaction we had along the project’s journey… not to mention every artefact he delivered.

                            I started working with Kocha when our product was at it’s very inception. Building v1.0 of a new product is extremely challenging, but with Kocha’s help our product has come to life in a wonderfully intuitive way.

                            The ability to give Kocha a conceptual UX problem to solve and then work through his many great ideas was a great learning experience for me. We gave Kocha a few curve balls, like dealing with Branding at the same time as setting up the initial UX and Kocha always delivered the goods.I benefited from Kocha’s thoughtful application of his skills and experience as a product designer and have a new appreciation for the power of great design.

                            During my time at Freelancer.com Kocha was the Mobile design team lead. He pushed user interaction, satisfaction and retention to an all time high, accomplished his tasks to brief and usually ahead of time. I was lucky to have worked with him on a few projects and the direction he gave me to animate and create was clear and direct. There were few revisions as he knew what he needed down to the pixel and motion.

                            He also created and tested new products for the mobile team which made the process of the product more efficient. He is extremely design minded, professional and has a great working attitude. Anyone would be lucky to have them on their team.

                            Kocha is a talented designer/artist who produces work that is functional, creative and original. Kocha has vast experience conversing with stakeholders and collaborating with colleagues to translate a vision and bring an idea to life. Kocha has many passions outside of his day to day work that include sketching, screen printing, photography and music (guitar). Creative endeavour is his passion, an expression of who he is, and it shows in his work. I worked closely with Kocha and he was a pleasure to work with. He has a proven track record. He is a deep thinker and a truly unique individual who, when it comes to design, will not settle for second best
