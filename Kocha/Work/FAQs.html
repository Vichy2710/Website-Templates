                                I believe being able to live a life of service to others is an enormous privilege. I am learning by helping people solve their complex problems with the design.

                                I have no philosophy and not interested in awards or design trends, but form follows function. The idea comes first, then prototype, then further improvement based on what we have learned  —  as simple as that.

                                I believe that no one is too small to make a difference. I assist people ranging from solopreneurs to in-house product teams, from start-ups to tech companies. If you had open-minded and willing to identify a problem, I do my best to help you find a design solution.

                                What motivates you at work?

                            <div class="answer">
                                Motivation is emotional and not reliable. As a professional designer, I don’t have the privilege to wait for emotions. Discipline works much better for me. I only need a quiet place to get started, and continuing will be much easier.

                                Have you done a project like mine before?

                            <div class="answer">
                                Chances are if I recently have done a similar project in the past few months — I probably won’t take your project as a courtesy to my client and professional advancements. Nevertheless, I often find myself exploring unrealistic yet intriguing ideas rather than repeating the same process over and over again.

                            <div class="answer">
                                I often find myself excited about the challenging problem. And I always admire the freeform shape of nature and the magic of music.

                            <div class="answer">
                                I am a constantly curious learner. I can come to the table with humility and collaboration rather than a need to prove myself.

                                As a designer, I am very comfortable with ambiguity, and I learn by doing. It can be annoying to people who want to nail down specifics quickly.

                                I see myself growing as an individual contributor who learns something new with other people every single day (and perhaps, I may have my hit track on Spotify!)

                                Portfolio publication terms?

                            <div class="answer">
                                Just like other creatives and designers, I display the design work as a recognition of creative excellence. In general, after I deliver the project, I will delay my portfolio up to 90 days — or as soon as the project goes public. Sorry, I DO NOT work as a white label.
