            <p>
                The type of information we collect from you depends on how you use our Sites. Generally, when using our Sites, we may collect personal information in two ways: (1.) you provide it to us, or (2.) it is obtained automatically via tracking technologies. In the case of conducting a business, we collect a range of personal information including, names, email addresses, phone number, or photographs and so forth.
            </p>
            <p>
                This may be through contact forms, emails, receipts, telephone conversations, proposal, invoice, consultations or attendance in-person. We only collect what we need by fair, lawful and with your knowledge or consent and we will only retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide you with a service.
            </p>
            <p>
                We make all reasonable endeavours to ensure the storage provider is compliant and information held by us is safe, secure and protected from unauthorised access, modification, disclosure and loss.
